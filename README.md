Firstly I have created a div class to target css as well javascript  Secondly I have added a head tag h1 to add calculator which will display in the live screen.  Then I have made a input type to show the calculator screen.The input tag is specifically meant to enter data. Then I made a table to display all the numbers.Then I made a table tag and inside tr(table row) I have added td Inside that I have added some buttons.Then in similar manner I have copy pasted it.In js in  second  line by writing queryselectorall it takes all buttons Then when writing the for(items of buttons) Arrow functions is used Arrow functions returns value by default.E.target led to the button on which we are moving on and This line will help me to get the value written in innertext.The eval() method evaluates or executes an argument. If the argument is an expression, eval() evaluates the expression. If the argument is one or more JavaScript statements, eval() executes the statements.
